# DZ Pi Piggy Bank

This is a Pi application developed on the Pi Network Testnet.

## Purpose of the Application

This application aims to serve as a piggy bank for Pi miners, helping them securely manage their Pi balances.

## Current Status and Known Issues (Important Note for Pi Core Team)

The application has been successfully published in the Pi App Studio and has been assigned a `.pinet.com` URL. However, we are continuously experiencing issues with accessing it in the Pi Browser.

**Observed Errors:**

* "404 Not Found" errors in the Pi Browser.
* Network errors such as "net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE."
* The application is not appearing in the app listings within the Pi Browser.
* On the Pi Ecosystem page, it is listed as a "Testnet App" but simultaneously and contradictorily marked as "Not a PiNet App."
* When the application loads, a warning (exclamation mark) is visible in the interface, suggesting a lack of full connection with the Pi Network.
* Recently, a "Third-party App Consent" pop-up has started appearing upon app access; while this indicates some progress, fundamental access issues persist.

**Naming Confusion and Reverted Changes:**

Upon a request from the Pi App Studio, we changed the repository and associated file names from "Piggy" to "Pigg." This change was successfully validated in App Studio, and a development URL reflecting the new "Pigg" name was assigned (e.g., `https://sipan2504.github.io/dz-pi-pigg-bank/`). However, despite this change, the issues in the Pi Browser persisted. As a solution was not found, we have since reverted the repository name and file paths back to the original "Piggy" (i.e., `dz-pi-piggy-bank`).

This situation strongly indicates an inconsistency within Pi Network's internal app registration, routing, and caching mechanisms. As developers, we are confident that we have followed all Pi App Studio instructions.
